Hello and welcome to our game World War 4!

We will explain in detail the workings and the goal of our game.

Goal and Mechanics:

The goal of our game is to find the reserve of our bunker, which is a room among the 25 existing rooms.

You can move through the rooms using the shortcuts provided for directions such as:

- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right

You have the option to embody two character classes:

- Human
- Robot

The specificity of the human is that it has a maximum of 5 hearts but can regenerate 2 hearts at once.

The specificity of the robot is that it has a maximum of 6 hearts but can regenerate only one heart at a time.

In each room, you may encounter traps that you can avoid, monsters that you can eliminate, and chests in which you may find either one or two hearts, depending on your health points and your class, or you may find a weapon.
This weapon will be useful later on.

In the reserve, there will be an epic monster that can be considered the final boss, which must be eliminated to win the game. 
However, you cannot simply kill the final boss with your bare hands, you must first find the chest containing a weapon. 
Once you obtain the weapon, you will have the opportunity to eliminate the boss.

Once the final boss is eliminated, you have won the game. 
Well done to you, thank you for reading this readme, 
and good luck to you in World War 4!
